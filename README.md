## **Introduction**

This experiment was performed at Physics Institute, University of Sao Paulo and it is part of modern physics laboratory classes. The purpose of the experiment is to analyse hidrogen and sodium spectrum using mercurium to calibrate the data. From the hidrogen part the final purpose is to calculate the Rydberg constant $R_H$ and from the sodium part the final purose is to calculate $R_H$
and the quantum corrections for Na atom.
There are six datasets, all of them have two columns: pixels and counts. And for both H and Na there is a Hg spectrum for calibration, since the equipament used for H and Na experiments were different (if the equipament was the same it could be used the same Hg spectrum to calibrate both H and Na experiments). There are also datasets (for H and Na) focusing on the main peak of the spectrum.

## **Calibration with Hg spectroscopy**

The calibration procedure will be performed for both H and Na spectroscopy.
The step by step of the precedure:

- Plot the data counts vs pixels.
  - OBS.: the left side pixels correspond to UV (ultraviolet) region and the right side pixels corrspond to IR (infrared) region.
- Identify the Hg spectrum lines using the Hg-H.png image and/or the NIST table for Hg and relate the wavelenght of the lines to the pixel position.
- Plot wavelenght vs pixels and fit a linear equation to obtain the calibration equation.


## **Part 1: H spectroscopy**

- Identify in pixels the lines of H spectrum.
- Use the calibration equation to find the correspondent wavelenght.
- Plot a graph that connects wavelenght and the quantum number **n**.
- Fit linear equation to calculate $R_H$.

## **Part 2: Na spectroscopy**

- Identify in pixels the lines of Na spectrum.
- Use the calibration equation to find the correspondent wavelenght.
- Plot a graph that connects wavelenght and the quantum number **n** for every Na series.
- Calculate $R_H$.
- Calculate quantum corrections.
